# Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBD http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/


# Data Engineering

1. Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Be sure to do the following:

Remember to specify the data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

For the primary keys, verify that the column is unique. Otherwise, create a composite https://bootcampspot.instructure.com/courses/5229/assignments/74093?module_item_id=1208412#:~:text=.-,Data%20Engineering,Import%20each%20CSV%20file%20into%20its%20corresponding%20SQL%20table.,-HINT
 which takes two primary keys to uniquely identify a row.

Be sure to create the tables in the correct order to handle the foreign keys.

2. Import each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table.


# Data Analysis

3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
